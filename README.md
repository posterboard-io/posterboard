## About Posterboard
Posterboard is an open source job board. By developers for developers. I started this entire project about a month ago and I really hate that fact that modern companies require subscriptions to just get basic insights to the job market. All of the data that's used in this app has been scraped from the internet and is actively updated everyday. I've only been working on this project for about a month and there's a lot of code and features that are halfway completed. 

I'm planning to continue to grind this project out. This unveiling is pretty much the first start of allowing anyone to review it, suggest things, and build on top of it. It took roughly the whole month of November to get this basic MVP together so I'm hoping I can add a lot more the month of December.

Also to anyone who wants to contribute, I'm sorry but I need to first put together a better enviroment for development. That's on my todo list and first priority. When it's just a solo-hobby project you tend to test a lot in prod lol. 

Also going to give a special shoutout to all the work and additional code I have "borrowed", that's following soon. The new app router idea, is great but ðŸ˜¬ there's like 0 documentation.

## Stack
- Built with the T3 stack and honestly it's so good I can't imagine building anything else for the web without using it. TRPC has got to be one of the greatest frameworks of all time.
- I'm planning to do a full in-depth dive and eventually migrate to a mono-repo with Turbo too. Maybe even an Expo app. Right now it's just one thing at a time.
